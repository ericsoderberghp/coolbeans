TODO:
- 'hide $' mode, translate all displayed values into percentages of assets?
- test keyboard interaction
- invest extra income
- debt, mortgages, etc.

- multiple data sets, to allow showing different scenarios
- implement asset classes: large cap, small cap, international, alternative

- enhance social security with per-age payments and choice on when to start claiming
- use API to get current stock prices
- Medicare
- charts
- slider controls to adjust values and watch projections change in real time
   perhaps a "focused" number?
