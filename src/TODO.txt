TODO:
- implement asset classes: large cap, small cap, international, alternative

- test keyboard interaction
- debt, mortgages, etc.

- multiple data sets, to allow showing different scenarios

- enhance social security with per-age payments and choice on when to start claiming
- Medicare
- charts
- slider controls to adjust values and watch projections change in real time
   perhaps a "focused" number?
